\title{Get Similarity Score}
\usage{
get_score(rf, d)
}
\arguments{
\item{rf}{A random forest created with 'randomForest'}

\item{d}{A distance between two handwriting samples, calculated with
'get_distances'}
}
\value{
A number
}
\description{
Use a trained random forest to produce a similarity score for the distance
between two handwriting samples.
}
\examples{
# Select the cluster fill rates for two handwriting samples
df <- cfr[1:2,]
# Calculate the Euclidean distance between the cluster fill rates
d <- get_distances(df, c("abs", "euc"))
score <- get_score(rf$rf, d)

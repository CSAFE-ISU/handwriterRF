## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed quotes around "same writer" and "different writer" in documentation.

* Removed dontrun{} from the examples for random_forest. Changed example for get_distances() to something that runs in less than 5 seconds and removed dontrun{} from this example. The examples for calculate_slr() take longer than 5 seconds to run so dontrun{} was changed to donttest{} for these examples.

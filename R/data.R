#' Cluster Fill Rates of 796 Handwritten Documents
#'
#' A dataset containing the cluster fill rates of 796 handwritten
#' documents from the CSAFE Handwriting Database. The cluster fill rates
#' are derived from the cluster fill counts calculated by 'handwriter' with
#' the 'get_clusters_batch' function. The variables are as follows:
